        Duration: 1 hour, 25 minutes and 53 seconds.1:25:53 20,000 Leagues Under
        the Sea is an American silent film directed by Stuart Paton and released
        on December 24, 1916. Based primarily on the 1870 novel Twenty Thousand
        Leagues Under the Seas by Jules Verne, the film also incorporates
        elements from Verne's 1875 novel The Mysterious Island. This was the
        first motion picture filmed underwater. Actual underwater cameras were
        not used, but a system of watertight tubes and mirrors allowed the
        camera to shoot reflected images of underwater scenes staged in shallow
        sunlit waters in the Bahamas. For the scene featuring a battle with an
        octopus, cinematographer John Ernest Williamson devised a viewing
        chamber called the "photosphere", a 6-by-10-foot (1.8-by-3.0-metre)
        steel globe in which a cameraman could be placed. The film was made by
        the Universal Film Manufacturing Company (now Universal Pictures), not
        then known as a major motion picture studio, and took two years to make,
        at the cost of $500,000.
